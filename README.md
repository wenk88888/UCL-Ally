# UCL-Ally

## Problem Statement and Inspiration
The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly has impacted student experience at higher education insitution which has caused a lack of sense of space and belonging as a member of university. This has adverse effect on the emotional wellbeing and consequently their academic performance and overall student satisfaction.

Common questions by new and current UCL students :
- How well do you know about the spaces and facilities available at UCL and how you should make full use of them?
- Do you know there are more than 50 student events every week on average but do you know how to balance your academic commitments and extracurricular activities?
- Feeling emotional or depressed, do you know there are support available at UCL and how to access them?

Students normally get alerts on events around them and bulk of information in the form of newsletter that most people do not go through in detail and consequently miss events that may be of interest to them.

Inspired by voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Bixby and automated chat bots, we want to create a tool which is interactive, engaging and user-friendly which ensures that students receive personalised recommendations for contents they like and smart suggestions to help them navigate through various situations.
